# ðŸ“„ EasierPS & EasierSoP

**EasierPS** and **EasierSoP** are enhanced versions of [EasyPS](https://github.com/salfaris/EasyPS), featuring improved display and extended functionality. This project provides simple and elegant LaTeX templates for managing Personal Statement (PS) and Statement of Purpose (SoP) across multiple graduate school applications.

## Installation

### Run on Overleaf (Recommended)

I have uploaded the templates to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). You can access them by clicking the link below:

[Open **EasierPS** & **EasierSoP** Template on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/easierps-and-easiersop-personal-statement-and-statement-of-purpose-framework/fnxgsvqgpkgk)

### Run Locally

If you are running the LaTeX compilation locally, you should download the `zip` file by either clicking the green **Code** button above, or clone the repository if you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DaizeDong/Easier-PS-and-SoP.git
```

## Usage

The project contains two independent templates (**EasierPS** & **EasierSoP**), and you should first select the one you need. The following instructions are for **EasierSoP**, but they are also applicable to **EasierPS**.

1. Go to the `easier_sop` directory and open `main.tex`.

2. Change these variables accordingly:
   ```latex
   % --- ESSAY DISPLAY SETTINGS ---
   \SetStudentName{StudentName}           % Your name
   \SetProgramName{ProgramName}           % Program you're applying for
   \SetUniversityName{UniversityName}     % University name
   \SetUniversityAbbr{\GetUniversityName} % University abbreviation (default as the university name if not set)
   
   % --- CONTENT INPUT FILES ---
   \SetBaseContentPath{content/base}      % Name to the input file (base)
   \SetUniContentPath{content/university} % Name to the input file (university)
   ```

3. Open the `easier_sop` directory and create the `.tex` files as you inserted in the `SetBaseContentPath` and `SetUniContentPath`. Then write the different parts of your SoP in them accordingly. To reference your papers, just add the according **BibTeX** citations in `easier_sop/ref.bib`.
    - `BaseContentPath`: The common part of your SoP, such as the research experiences and research interests.
    - `UniContentPath`: The university-specific part of your SoP, such as the professors you want to work with.
    - *Note: If you don't want to separate your SoP into two parts, just leave the base `.tex` file empty and write all contents in the university-specific `.tex` file.*

4. Build your PDF file as usual.

## Examples

For reference, I have provided an `example.tex` file for both **EasierPS** and **EasierSoP** (generated by [ChatGPT-4o](https://chatgpt.com/), featuring the fictional character SpongeBob SquarePants). This example demonstrates how the templates work with illustrative content. You can compile these files to view the output and better organize your own file structure.

Here is also an example PDF generated by **EasierSoP**: [example.pdf](docs/example.pdf).

## New Features

- Added support for Statement of Purpose (SoP) in addition to Personal Statement (PS).
- Adjusted template formats for PS and SoP to meet their specific requirements.
- Organized the files into a shared `base.tex` and the university-specific `xxx.tex` for better reuse.
- Included detailed annotations for easy understanding and customization.
- Enhanced the display with improvements in fonts, titles, and references.
